Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a diabetic eye disease, manifests as damage to the retina due to blood leakage, 
leading to the development of Red Lesions (Microaneurysms and Hemorrhages) and Bright Lesions (Hard Exudates 
and Cotton Wool Spots). Chronic, uncontrolled diabetes is the primary cause, with delayed treatment potentially 
resulting in complete blindness. DR is clinically categorized into four stages: No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, and 
Severe DR. Manual detection of DR by ophthalmologists is time-consuming, causing prolonged suffering for patients. 
To address this, our research leverages advanced technological tools like MATLAB to automate lesion extraction and 
feature analysis. By quantifying parameters such as lesion number, area, perimeter, and solidity, our model aims to 
accurately categorize DR severity. Specifically, we focus on utilizing the area covered by lesions to determine the 
disease stage, providing valuable insights into disease progression. Our approach not only accelerates the detection 
process but also enhances accuracy, potentially improving patient outcomes. By automating lesion extraction and 
analysis, our system reduces the burden on ophthalmologists, allowing for more efficient allocation of healthcare 
resources. This research contributes to the field by offering a robust method for DR assessment, facilitating early 
intervention and treatment.
